        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>
                 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F(200 degreesC).
                 Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.               
            </li>
            <li>
                 Stir flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar together in a large bowl;
                 make a well in the center.
            </li>
            <li>
                 Beat egg with a fork in a small bowl or 2-cup measuring cup; whisk in milk and oil.
                 Pour egg mixture all at once into flour mixture; mix quickly and lightly with a fork
                 until just moistened. The batter will be lumpy. (Fold in additional ingredients if using;
                 see variations below). Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.
            </li>
            <li>
                 Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 25 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
